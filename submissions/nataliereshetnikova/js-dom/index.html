            If you already love sparkling wine,
            give yourself a pat on the back for your exquisite taste.
            This wine first came about in France and is synonymous with the region of Champagne.
            Despite the lowly appeal of many grocery store options (e.g. Cook’s),
            sparkling wines are the most technically challenging and time intensive wines made in the world.
            Champagne is often too price restrictive, so instead,
            keep your eyes peeled for Brut-level sparklers (i.e. not sweet)
            like Cava, Prosecco, Crémant or perhaps a $12–16 American bubbly.
