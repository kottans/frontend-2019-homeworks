    content: 'Heroes of Might and Magic III: The Restoration of Erathia (commonly referred to as Heroes of Might & Magic 3, or simply ' +
  'Heroes 3) is a turn-based strategy game developed by Jon Van Caneghem through New World Computing originally released for ' +
  'Microsoft Windows by the 3DO Company in 1999. Its ports to several computer and console systems followed in 1999-2000. It is the ' +
  'third installment of the Heroes of Might and Magic series. The game\'s story is first referenced throughout Might and Magic VI: ' +
  'The Mandate of Heaven and serves as a prequel to Might and Magic VII: For Blood and Honor. The player can choose to play through ' +
  'seven different campaigns telling the story, or play in a scenario against computer or human opponents. The gameplay is very ' +
  'similar to its predecessors in that the player controls a number of heroes that command an army of creatures inspired by myth and ' +
  'legend. The gameplay is divided into two parts, tactical overland exploration and a turn based combat system. The player creates ' +
  'an army by spending resources at one of the eight town types in the game. The hero will progress in experience by engaging in ' +
  'combat with enemy heroes and monsters. The conditions for victory vary depending on the map, including conquest of all enemies ' + 
  'and towns, collection of a certain amount of a resource, or finding the grail artifact. Heroes III was released to universal ' +
  'acclaim and was praised by critics. The game received the expansion packs Heroes of Might and Magic III: Armageddon\'s Blade and ' +
  'Heroes of Might and Magic III: The Shadow of Death. Heroes Chronicles, a series of short introductory games based on the Heroes III' +
  'engine, was also released. A special version of Heroes III titled Heroes III Complete, which included the original game and both ' + 
  'expansion packs, was released in 2000. On December 10, 2014, Ubisoft announced an HD version of the game. The new version features ' + 
  'updated graphics as well as wide screen compatibility and was released on January 29, 2015 for Microsoft Windows, iOS and Android.' +
  '[2] However, the expansions have not been re-released because their source code is lost.[3] Numerous unofficial patches and mods ' +
  'made by the dedicated fan - such as the HD mod, In the Wake of Gods mod, and the Horn of the Abyss mod - have substantially ' +
  'improved the games\' stability, balance and features.'

  'Antagarich. During the campaigns, the story is told from alternating points of view, giving players the opportunity to play as ' +
  'each of the town alignments.Following the disappearance of King Roland Ironfist of Enroth prior to Might and Magic VI: The Mandate ' +
  'of Heaven, his wife, Queen Catherine, is left to rule the realm. In the meantime, her father, King Gryphonheart of Erathia, is ' +
  'assassinated. Without their beloved King, the kingdom of Erathia falls to the dark forces of Nighon and Eeofol. Queen Catherine ' +
  'returns home to Antagarich seeking to rally the people of her homeland and lead them against the evil that has ravaged their ' +
  'nation. Erathia\'s capital of Steadwick is sacked by the dungeon lords of Nighon and the Kreegans of Eeofol. Meanwhile, the ' +
  'nations of Tatalia and Krewlod skirmish at the western border, seizing the chance to expand their territory. Catherine\'s first ' +
  'task is to establish a foothold in the conquered kingdom by enlisting the aid of allies. The wizards of Bracada and the elves of ' +
  'AvLee answer her call, and together they push towards Steadwick and eventually retake it, quickly quelling the border war in the ' +
  'west. Soon after, Lucifer Kreegan, a commander in the Eeofol armies, sends an envoy to Erathia claiming that Roland Ironfist is ' +
  'captive within their territories. AvLee invades Eeofol, but fails to rescue Roland, who is transported to their northern holdings. ' +
  'Afterwards, Catherine invades Nighon, pushing the dungeon armies back to their island home. In the meantime, the necromancers of ' +
  'Deyja, having been responsible for the assassination of King Gryphonheart, plot to revive his corpse as a lich. They plan to use ' +
  'his wisdom in leading their own armies of the undead. However, King Gryphonheart\'s will proves too much for the necromancers even ' +
  'in his corrupted state, and he becomes a rogue lich. Having little other recourse, Queen Catherine is forced to ally herself with ' +
  'the necromancers and together they set out to destroy the lich of King Gryphonheart before he becomes too powerful. A final bonus ' +
  'campaign, accessible only after the main campaigns are complete, tells the story of separatists living in the Contested Lands, a ' +
  'war-torn border between Erathia and AvLee. Tired of the skirmishes that bring unrest to their homelands, they join together to ' +
  'fight for independence from the two large kingdoms. It is later implied that this rising was orchestrated by Archibald Ironfist, ' +
  'the antagonist of Heroes of Might and Magic II.'
