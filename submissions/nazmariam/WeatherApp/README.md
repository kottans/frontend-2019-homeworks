#Weather Application

Application consists of main component App.js and subcomponents: 
- ActualWeather,
- ForecastWeather,
- Search

There is WeatherDataService.js in src/services, that fetch data from Weather API.

At the moment I can't use method render (to transfer data from App to subcomponents) of class App in my service.
