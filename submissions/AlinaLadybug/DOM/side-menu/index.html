                <p>Facebook is a social networking website where users can post comments, share photographs and post
                    links to news or other interesting content on the web, chat live, and watch short-form video. You
                    can even order food on Facebook if that's what you want to do. Shared content can be made publicly
                    accessible, or it can be shared only among a select group of friends or family, or with a single
                    person.</p>

                <p>Instagram is a social networking app made for sharing photos and videos from a smartphone. Similar
                    to Facebook or Twitter, everyone who creates an Instagram account has a profile and a news feed.</P>
                <p>When you post a photo or video on Instagram, it will be displayed on your profile. Other users
                    who
                    follow you will see your posts in their own feed. Likewise, you'll see posts from other users
                    whom
                    you choose to follow.</p>

                <p>Pretty straight forward, right? It's like a simplified version of Facebook, with an emphasis on
                    mobile use and visual sharing. Just like other social networks, you can interact with other users
                    on Instagram by following them, being followed by them, commenting, liking, tagging and private
                    messaging. You can even save the photos you see on Instagram.

                <p>Twitter is an online news and social networking site where people communicate in short messages
                    called tweets. Tweeting is posting short messages for anyone who follows you on Twitter, with the
                    hope that your messages are useful and interesting to someone in your audience. Another description
                    of Twitter and tweeting might be microblogging.</p>

                <p>Some people use Twitter to discover interesting people and companies online, opting to follow their
                    tweets.</p>

                <p>Founded in 2005, YouTube is one of the most popular video sites on the Web today. Millions of videos
                    have been uploaded and shared here, ranging from movie trailers to amateur videos of cats — and
                    everything in between.</p>

                <p> Anyone with an Internet connection can share content on YouTube, whether they are organizations
                    with large budgets or an individual with a video camera. YouTube is owned by Google, and is one of
                    their most popular peripheral properties. YouTube was the first large-scale video sharing site on
                    the Web, and it is available in nearly every country and over fifty different languages. Anyone can
                    upload content here, which makes for an utterly astonishing array of watchable content.</p>
