    content: `<p><b>Cat</b> (voiced by Jim Cummings), a cat, is the smarter and more cunning of the two. He often
              devises plans to trick Dog into getting what he wants, such as making Dog smarter in an attempt to have
              more in common with him, or having him win a dog sledding contest by training him in a very hard and
              militaristic manner, and usually, as a result of his greediness and selfishness, these schemes all blow
              up in his face. With his brains and constant ridiculing from the rest of the characters, he is the more
              defensive and short tempered of the two. He and Dog are sometimes seen fighting with each other or
              bickering (as shown in the episodes 'Teeth for Two' and 'CatDog Candy'), and Dog even tried to eat him
              once in the episode 'Meat Dog's Friends'. Despite his quirks and spats with Dog, he loves his brother
              with his whole heart. He cares so deeply that he ends up helping Dog in the end once his guilty
              conscience gets to him. Cat has a 'rush' on Shriek. In one episode, Cat admits his love for Shriek and
              kisses her after Shriek kisses Dog and tells him she loves him (only to wind up getting pounded by the
              aggressive poodle). Cat desires fame and fortune and tends to go to excessive lengths in order to gain
              them. He is intelligent and enjoys reading, gardening, and listening to classical music. He is
              somewhat uptight and believes strongly in being polite and neat. He is a stickler for cleanliness and,
              like most cats, has aquaphobia. Despite his sophisticated personality, Cat also has a dark side.
              Whenever he snaps, he becomes a ruthless, psychopathic maniac of whom even the Greasers are scared,
              once they see what he is capable of doing (especially his stress-induced, superhuman strength, evident
              in one episode when he destroyed the Greasers' monster truck with a single punch).</p>`,

    id: "Dog",
    content: `<p><b>Dog</b> (voiced by Tom Kenny) is the more happy-go-lucky and more naive of the two. He is also the
              source of clumsiness. As his name implies, he is a dog. He is extremely ambitious when Cat or any other
              character convinces him to take on a task, diving right into it with full force and energy. Dog is the
              typical loyal dog and is easily convinced. He is quite gullible and will believe everything he is told.
              His attention span is very short and he is easily distracted by balls, garbage trucks, bones, food, and
              his overactive imagination. Because of his more simple nature, Dog usually is the one who gets the pair
              into trouble. Not paying attention to Cat's warnings, his actions almost always end up with some severe
              consequences. Despite this, in many of the episodes, it is shown that Dog is usually the one that is more
              popular and athletic of the two, such as the episode when CatDog both went back to school to complete
              Cat's last day of High School. Like Cat, Dog adores his brother and looks up to him no matter how many
              times Cat steers him into danger. He is often distracted with chasing shadows and chasing after tennis
              balls, and loves eating garbage. Much to the neat-freakish Cat's dismay, Dog leaves a mess everywhere
              he goes.</p>`,

    id: "Winslow",
    content: `<p><b>Winslow T. Oddfellow</b> (voiced by Carlos Alazraqui) is a tailless blue mouse that lives in
              CatDog's house in the hole in the wall, and the anti-hero of the series, next to The Greasers and Rancid
              Rabbit. Winslow speaks with a typical Brooklyn accent. Winslow is always full of wisecracks about
              anything and everything. He is very sneaky and underhanded with CatDog, especially with Cat. Winslow and
              Cat do not get along very well at all, because he is always getting Cat in trouble. However, it was
              eventually revealed that Winslow may be afraid of Cat, because Cat tried to eat him once. Dog, however,
              does not mind Winslow and is friendly with him. Deep down, he has a very big heart and loves Dog and at
              some point acts as CatDog's conscience and guidance for living in society, but acts out against them.
              His catchphrase is 'What are you? Nuts?'.</p>`,
