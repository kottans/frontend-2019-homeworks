### known issues
- Timezone issue, currently daily forecast and sunrise\sunset-time shows correct data only for GMT+2 timezone.
Unfortunatley, used API doesn't have timezones about requested region;
- Empty 'div' wrappers among layout which wraps Components (couldn't solve by my own);
- Tested and designed only in\for Chrome browser.
